# Home-Price-Competition
[ Notice! ] : real submission part starts from middle of page where written "2nd trial after 3 monthes"

Accuracy 89%, the first application for the competition is completed (1997/4386)! In fact, this project is valuable to me because it made me feel more estimable because I started working on this project 3 months ago and was only able to achieve only 1% accuracy. My methods were also at the very initial stage, sometimes I could not understand what was happening. As a result, I just stopped it. But today I wanted to test myself, how I could improve myself. When I finished, I compared everything and was very proud of myself. Because the difference is big (that time and today). I will keep to grow and learn! I'm really happy ^^
